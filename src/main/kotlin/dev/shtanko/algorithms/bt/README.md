# Binary Trees — "Must Know" Algorithms

You should be able to easily implement the following algorithms:

* In-Order: Traverse left node, current node, then right (usually used for binary search trees)
* Pre-Order: Traverse current node, then left node, then right node
* Post-Order: Traverse left node, then right node, then current node.
* Insert Node: On a binary search tree, we insert a value v, by comparing it to the root If v > root, we go right, and
  else we go left We do this until we hit an empty spot in the tree.

/**
 * Let us take unsigned integer (32 bit), which consist of 0-31 bits.
 * To print binary representation of unsigned integer, start from 31st bit, check whether 31st bit is ON or OFF,
 * if it is ON print “1” else print “0”. Now check whether 30th bit is ON or OFF, if it is ON print “1” else print “0”,
 * do this for all bits from 31 to 0, finally we will get binary representation of number.
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
